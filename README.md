## Terminology

### Team Roles & Positions

On both attack and defense, each player has a particular role to play. Regardless of the strategy, a particular player will nearly always fall into the jobs of one or more of the following. However, it should be noted that R6 is a dynamic and ever-changing game. No player will always be playing in their dedicated role, and no operator is limited to being played exclusively by players in a particular role. It is expected that all players are capable of playing all roles, though they will likely tend to be better at one specific role.

#### Attack Roles

- Entry - It is the job of an entry player to make first contact and clear an opening for the rest of the team to follow. Hold `W` and click on heads. Common entry operators include Ash, Zofia, and Iana.

- Support - Entry players cannot enter a room without knowing what's in it. It is the job of support players to be the eyes for entries, droning out a room for the entry player before they push. Support players often carry defuser and will likely be last into the building, though they should not be the player covering the rear as the team moves forward. Common support operators include Thermite, Capitao, and Gridlock.

- Flex - Often, an operator doesn't fall into either the entry or support category. We call these operators "flex operators," as they often can be played as either way. WSU often employs flex operators to perform unique tasks or provide otherwise unavailable utility. Operators that lean more towards entry are called "flex-entry." Operators that lean more towards support are called "flex-support." Common flex-entry operators include Sledge, Buck, and Zero. Common flex-support operators include Nomad, Jackal, and Zero.

#### Defense Roles

- Anchor - Anchors sit on or very close to site. Their main job is to lock down site and stall out the attackers as long as possible. In most situations, anchors should be careful when picking fights, and should usually prioritize their life above all else. Of course, exceptions occur. Common anchors include Smoke, Mira, and Maestro.

- Roamer - Roamers can be broken into two different categories: interference and flank. Both types play off site, often far away from site. Common roamers include Jager, Mozzie, and Vigil.\
  - Interference - Interference roamers start the round by playing in the expected path of the attackers. Their objective is normally to stall for time by lightly taking gunfights, falling back slowly towards site, shooting drones along the way. By burning attacker utility and drones, attackers are forced to take extra time to clear an area, which in turn gives them less time to make a push onto site.\
  - Flank - Flank roamers start the round out of the expected path of the attackers. Their objective is to catch the attackers by surprise later in the round by getting behind them after they have moved forward enough for forget about the flank location. Often, flank roamers will get a quick kill, then immediately retreat.

- Flex - Flex operators are those that can either anchor or roam. They may be used as onsite anchors, offsite anchors, and interference or flank roamers. Their objectives heavily depend on the strategy being employed. Common flex operators include Goyo, Valkyrie, and Aruni.

### Movement & Actions

- Swinging - Moving across an opening with the intention of killing a target through it. Might return to the side the player was originally on, or go to the other side.
- Peeking - Keeping tight to one side of an opening with the intention of killing a target through it, usually done by leaning towards the center of the opening. Peeker has the intention of quickly hiding.
- Quickpeeking - Peeking, but by doing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35WVcRvEWUA). Also known as the Shaiiko peek. Heavily exploits peeker's advantage. Less effective on LAN.
- Crossing - Moving from one side of an opening to another with the sole intention of moving.
- Flanking - Moving around a high-intensity area with the objective of creating a new flank to fight on.
- Holding - Aiming through an opening with the intention of waiting for an enemy to swing, and to shoot them when they do.
- Pressuring - "Throwing bullets" at an enemy. Shooting towards a target without exposing yourself much, but also without the intention of killing the target. Used to make a target fear your presence without actually exposing yourself to any risk.
- Pushing - Actively moving forwards down a hall or across a room.
- Falling back - Retreating towards a safer location
- Drop - Jumping down a hatch, balcony, or other ledge. Implies a target has gone from one floor to the floor immediately below.

### Misc

- Site - The bomb sites.
- Utility - Primary gadgets, secondary gadgets, and drones.
- Burning Utility - Using utility in a way that, while probably required, contributes little to nothing towards achieving the overall objective.
- Refrag - Killing an enemy that just killed a teammate.
- Stall - Waste time by forcing the enemy to burn utility.
- Playing to live - Holding a position with the intention of falling back just before getting overwhelmed. Shoot with the intention of threatening more than killing. Try to stall the enemy.
- Playing to die - Holding a position with the intention of giving it up only at the cost of your own life. Shoot with the intention of killing. May try to stall or try to immediately get a kill. Depends on the strategy.
- Peeker's advantage - Your game client updates your movements before everyone else's clients. When you peek, you can see the area for a small window of time before an enemy watching your angle can see you. This gives you a slight, but noticable, advantage in a gunfight.
- Pixel angle - An angle so thin, it is nearly impossible to see the person holding it from their target location. Do NOT peek a pixel angle. Can also be used to gather intel while remaining mostly hidden. Useful for turning what normally would be an angle to hold into one to swing, and therefore gain peekers advantage.

## Callouts

Being able to communicate with your team is vital to your (and the team's) success. Information must be relayed quickly and concisely. A callout should contain enough information that everyone knows exactly what is going on with no question, but concise enough so as not to clog comms.

As important as well-structured callouts are, the information they carry is more important. In the heat of battle, it is possible, and not uncommon, for the structure to be broken. Try to make the structure a habit. Do not get so involved with following the structure that the information is delayed or inaccurate. As you play competitively, and with experienced players, this should come naturally.

### Structure Of Callouts

There is a very specific format callouts should follow. The format is as follows:

`Operator` doing `action` at `location`\
or\
`Operator` at `location` doing `action`

For example, "Smoke holding red stairs" clearly tells players that there is a player holding red stairs. The fact that the callout includes the word "holding" means that the enemy is actively covering those stairs. This means that no one should push red without backup. Had the callout been "Smoke on red stairs," there may be reason to push the staircase, if the Smoke is unaware. The operator name, Smoke, tells you a lot about how to approach the situation. Smoke is an anchor, which means he will likely stay in that position unless dislodged or incentivized to move through some other method, like heavy pressure from another angle. Smoke players often run the shotgun, meaning that if the fight can be taken at long range, it might be a free kill. At short range, however, an attacker would be running towards certain death. Note that one should never decide on a potential life-threatening decision on the difference between "holding" and "on" in a callout.

Also note that the action portion is optional. If the action is undeterminable, irrelevant, or easily implied, the callout can be condensed. For example, on Villa, if someone is playing in 90, they often are attempting to cover either bar hall or trophy hall. Which side should be obvious, given the side the attackers are taking. Therefore, the callout "Jager holding bar hall in 90" can be compressed to "Jager 90." The action is implied.

The team has a running joke of a former player's callout, "Jager vibing on catwalk." While it is used jokingly, it very well conveys the intended message. There is an enemy, Jager, playing on catwalk, with the expectation that if a teammate pushes him, the teammate will likely die. This does not, however, mean that the word "vibing" should be used to describe an action in a competitive setting.

If you are assisting a teammate in killing an enemy by using a drone or camera to spot the target for them, callouts can follow a different format:

`location` doing `action`\
or\
`location` `standing/crouching/prone` doing `action`

In this situation, the operator name is either already known or irrelevant. The most pressing information is the location of the enemy. The faster you can provide your teammate with an accurate and detailed location of the enemy, the easier time your teammate will have taking them out.

### When To Make Callouts

Callouts should be made at any of the following points in time:

- When you discover a new or updated location of an enemy\
  - Any time an enemy is initally discovered\
  - Any time an enemy moves between rooms, especially when moving towards a potentailly unaware teammate\
  - Any time the enemy retreats or surrenders a position they were previously holding\
  - Note that calling out a specific location in a room is relevant if a teammate is ready to act on the information. At this time, it can be worth to continously call out locations (optionally standing/crouching/prone), so the entry player knows the exact location of the immediate threat. Do NOT flood comms with minor position adjustments if no one is ready to act on the information.

- When you get a kill\
  - Any time you get a kill, it is vital the team knows who died, and where. A void in a defensive hold is often a worthwile reason for attackers to push.

- When you die\
  - Ideally, it should be impossible for the defenders to get a double kill. If an attacker dies, the location of the defender who killed them should be conveyed as quickly as possible so as to save the life of teammates, or ideally, for a teammate to refrag. The format may be modified to "`location`" or "`location`, `operator`" to help speed up communications. If a teammate is able to avenge you, or you avenge a teammate, the callout "refragged" is permittable, but only if the refrag was quick enough such that the rest of the callout would have been duplicated with the inital one.

- When a known operator at a known location stays in that location, but does an action that immediately impacts the team or a teammate. For example, a Pulse playing in a basement below the attack vector is a noteworthy callout, but Pulse is a _massive_ threat to a teammate above. If the Pulse goes from playing laterally to his scanner, watching above, the teammate above needs to be notified. If a player suddenly comes under intense danger, it may be worthwile to call for players to evacuate or move before making a normal callout.
