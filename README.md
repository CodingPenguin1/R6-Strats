## Purpose

This website is intended to be a guide for all players actively on the [Wright State University Collegiate Esports Club's](https://discord.gg/smmV38d) team for [Rainbow Six: Siege](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege). It is comprised of an in-depth guide guide to our [attack philosophy](#Attack-Philosophy), [defense philosophy](#Defense-Philosophy), and a detailed description of all our strategies.

## Terminology

Definitions of commonly used terms are important to understand before continuing.

### Team Roles & Positions

On both attack and defense, each player has a particular role to play. Regardless of the strategy, a particular player will nearly always fall into the jobs of one or more of the following. However, it should be noted that R6 is a dynamic and ever-changing game. No player will always be playing in their dedicated role, and no operator is limited to being played exclusively by players in a particular role. It is expected that all players are capable of playing all roles, though they will likely tend to be better at one specific role.

#### Attack Roles

- Entry - It is the job of an entry player to make first contact and clear an opening for the rest of the team to follow. Common entry operators include Ash, Zofia, and Iana.
- Support - Entry players cannot enter a room without knowing what's in it. It is the job of support players to be the eyes for entries, droning out a room for the entry player before they push. Support players often carry defuser and will likely be last into the building, though they should not be the player covering the rear as the team moves forward. Common support operators include Thermite, Capitao, and Gridlock.
- Flex - Often, an operator doesn't fall into either the entry or support category. We call these operators "flex operators," as they often can be played as either way. WSU often employs flex operators to perform unique tasks or provide otherwise unavailable utility. Operators that lean more towards entry are called "flex-entry." Operators that lean more towards support are called "flex-support." Common flex-entry operators include Sledge, Buck, and Zero. Common flex-support operators include Nomad, Jackal, and Zero.
