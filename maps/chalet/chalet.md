**Strategies**:

## Brain dump:

## Key locations

Library
Office

Roam clear top, work down
hard to do any other way really
exception to master

## Sites

### Master/Office

#### Office

1. Take library

2. Catwalk & Master window

3. Execute on site

#### Master

1. Kill solarium stairs player

   - 2 sol window, 1 trophy window to kill sol stairs player, flash and nade (or capitao?)

   - enter west main, buck for vert, shoot through north wall to hit sol stairs

2. Kill bathroom player

   - trophy window rotates to master window

   - 2 below play vertical, try to shoot bathroom player or nade if in tub

   - rappel threatens bathroom from sol window (don't hold), other rappel drones

3. Buck from below opens hallway ceiling, flushing out closet and master couch player and pop potential electric

4. Breach master north wall and plant behind couch

   - master window player locks out books

   - sol rappel covers master/office rotate

   - other sol rappel covers sol stairs from bathroom door

### Kitchen/Dining

1. Take library

2. Control lobby, don't need to fully take

3. Take piano

4. Take box with wall breach

5. Take master and bathroom

6. Vert on kitchen/dining

7. Either take dining or kitchen, depending on control

   - If control for dining:
     - go down library stairs
     - drone games/bar
     - enter and plant dining
   - If control for kitchen
     - DO NOT GO DOWN SOL STAIRS OR ENTER TROPHY
     - 1 entry drops hatch, followed by planter
       - everyone else plays vertical

### Bar/Games

Going for a games plant

1. Take sol, bedroom, bathroom, piano, office

2. Breach box in 1 of two ways. Want to kill library stairs player

   - West wall (towards stairs)
     - Harder to fight (close angle to piano door), but safer from lobby/piano
   - South wall (lobby catwalk)
     - Allows to rotate to catwalk door, but vulnerable to lobby. Nice for pressuring library connector

3. Rotate 2 to piano balc, pressure to drop or kill piano player (possibly assisted by box hole)

4. Push 1 down library stairs

5. Kill closet player in 1 of 2 ways, then go for plant:

   - Kill from hatch
     - is supposedly possible
     - drop entry through hatch, immediately followed by support
       - focus on killing bar player
       - plant on right half wall (NOT TALL ENOUGH TO COVER PLANTERS HEAD)
   - Kill from fireplace stairs
     - Drone then drop kitchen hatch, push up to lobby connector to watch lobby flanks
     - hibana down lobby stairs, breach wall of closet
       - combined with hatch, should be able to kill closet
     - move lobby double door player to bar door, pressure behind bar
     - drop entry through hatch, focus on killing bar player
     - support goes out library window to games window
       - plant on right half wall (NOT TALL ENOUGH TO COVER PLANTERS HEAD)

6. plant on half wall on the far side of the games window (NOT TALL ENOUGH TO COVER PLANT)

### Garage/Wine
